-  get data using webcam by running [face_dataset.py](https://github.com/yeasin50/face_detection_using_OpenCV/blob/master/face_dataset.py)

-  Train data running [trainer.py](https://github.com/yeasin50/face_detection_using_OpenCV/blob/master/trainer.py)

-  verify work by running [face_recognition.py](https://github.com/yeasin50/face_detection_using_OpenCV/blob/master/face_recognition.py)
